## Upgrading 2.1.0 → 3.19

Chart 0.3.0 replaces web with the 3.19.0 dashboard on port 4000 and explicitly configures CE servers, private bridge access and health probes. This upgrade requires a scheduled maintenance window, coordinated backups, migration rehearsal and consumer checks. Follow the [upgrade runbook](docs/UPGRADE-3.19-RUNBOOK.md) and the [chart upgrade notes](charts/novu/README.md#upgrading-210--319). No migrations run automatically on Helm/Argo sync.
